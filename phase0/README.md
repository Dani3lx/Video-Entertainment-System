**CSC207 Summer 2022 Phase 0 - Login Explorer** is group 0249's login backbone for their CSC207 project.  It aims to cover all of the required functionality for phase 0 specifications whilst still following clean architecture guidelines.  We expect to add onto this backbone to create a video explorer system (akin to Youtube) in the future.

## Quick Start 
1. Set SDK to Amazon Coretto 11
2. Run Main.Main
3. At the login menu
    * For non-admin user, create a new account
    * For admin user the login credentials are:
        * **Username:** admin
        * **Password:** admin
4. There will be separate menus for admin and non-admin where you can change password and check previous login history
5. When you log out, you will be returned to the login menu 
    * **You Must Exit Program by inputting 3 in order for the session history to be saved**
